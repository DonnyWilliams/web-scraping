# web-scraping
This is a program I wrote while taking Zero To Mastery Academy's Complete Python Developer in 2021 course. This program scrapes HackerNews.com and prints the title, link and vote numbers for each story on the front page that has more than 100 votes, in order starting with the greatest number of votes, working down to 100.

scrape.py includes notes on what each line of code does.
scrape_clean.py is the same thing, but without notes.
scrape_2pages.py scrapes the first two pages of HackerNews.com, instead of just the first page.
